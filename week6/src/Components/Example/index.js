               freak of nature, they will wrap his body
               in newspaper and carry him to the museum.
           </p>
           <p>But tonight he is alive and in the north
               field with his mother. It is a perfect
               summer evening: the moon rising over
               the orchard, the wind in the grass. And
               as he stares into the sky, there are
               twice as many stars are usual.
